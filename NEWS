1.1-0   (under development)
    o	The interface to the R process has been enhanced to support
	request body and other methods including POST. A new global
	variable `request' is a list that is populated with various
	entries pertinent to the request:

        request$uri - URI of the request (used to be request.URI)
        request$method - method type (as string) such as "GET"
	request$c.type - content type of the request body
	request$c.length - length of the request body (-1 if
                           there is no body)
	request$body - raw vector containing the body of the request
        request$client.ip - IP address of the client (as string)

	All strings are guaranteed to be "" if not set.
	request$body will be NULL if there is no body.

    o	The interface to the R process now sets a global variable
	`webapi` which is a real number that defines the version of
	the interface used to pass information. It is now set to 1.1
	and guarantees the information described above. This number
	will be increased in case new features are added to the API
	between the R process and the web server.

    o	Rcgi now automatically falls back to the body of the request
	if it has content type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and
	the query string is empty. Other content types need to be
	processed by the `run' function if needed.

    o	Rcgi will respond with appropriate status code to various
	error conditions, such as failed connection. Previously, Rcgi
	would always respond with 200 OK.

    o	Rcgi bugfix: the parameter sanitization code was behaving
	improperly.
